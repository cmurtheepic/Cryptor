# Cryptor
my Cryptography App

The purpose of this app, is to take a given text that the user provides. and to take it, convert it into a encoded text using a cipher that the user selects. that then is outputted to the user in another activity view for the user to use, and possibly share to other apps.

I am also using tutorials to have made this app from multiple sites such as these :

The development of this Android App is well documented here in a youtube playlist :
